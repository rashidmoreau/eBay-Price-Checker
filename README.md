Python script that allows users to input an item name and its condition, and retrieves the average price, shipping price, and total cost for that item from eBay listings. The script interacts with the eBay website to scrape pricing information, computes the averages, and returns the results to the user. This tool is useful for anyone interested in quickly comparing prices for specific items on eBay before making a purchase decision.
